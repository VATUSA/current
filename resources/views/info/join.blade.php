                <h3>Join as ATC</h3>
                <p>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to consider joining the Virtual Air Traffic
                    Simulation Network's
                    USA Division (VATUSA). This network represents the single, most complex airspace in the world
                    featuring 2015's world's
                    most busiest airport, and 4 of the top 10 (according to Airports Council International). Each day,
                    on average, over 2,000,000
                    passengers traverse across the US airspace on Air Transport (followed by China at just over 1
                    million, and the UK at 350,000).</p>
