                <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider joining the Virtual Air Traffic
                    Simulation Network's
                    USA Division (VATUSA). This network represents the single, most complex airspace in the world
                    featuring 2015's world's
                    most busiest airport, and 4 of the top 10 (according to Airports Council International). Each day,
                    on average, over 2,000,000
                    passengers traverse across the US airspace on Air Transport (followed by China at just over 1
                    million, and the UK at 350,000).</p>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After you join the VATUSA division, you must complete the <strong>"<u>Block 1</u> - Basic
                            ATC/S1"</strong> Computer Based Training (CBT) course. This can be found at <a href="/cbt">https://www.vatusa.net/cbt</a></b>
                        . <u>ALL</u> items under Block 1 must be checked complete before you will be permitted to start
                        the Basic ATC Exam.
                    </li>
                    <li> Pass the "Basic/S1 Exam." Click on the "Assign Basic ATC Exam" under "My VATUSA" to be assigned
                        the exam. If it's already assigned, that link will not appear, and can be taken from the "Exam

                    </li>

                    <li>After completing the initial exam, you will be able to join a facility. VATUSA is
                        made up of 21 ARTCCs and 1 CCF
                        [realworld FAA includes 2 CENRAPs, Guam which is under jurisdiction of Honolulu Combined Control
                        Facility and San Juan CENRAP which is part of VATCAR on VATSIM].
                        To join your first facility, go to "My VATUSA" in the Navigation Bar, then select "Join
                        Facility". <br>
                        <strong>If you are a returning member, you must request a transfer into your ARTCC of
                            choice.</strong>
                        <br>
                        Once you have successfully joined a facility, you will receive a welcome email upon facility
                        selection. Initial selections are immediate; those requesting a transfer will receive the
                        welcome email once the transfer request has been accepted. This should include instructions on
                        what to do next. You may receive subsequent follow ups once they have added you to their
                        facility website. If you do not hear anything within a few days, please open a ticket with your
                        facility.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Before you obtain your S1 rating or return from inactivity, you must complete training and an
                            over-the-shoulder examination at your initial facility. After joining, the process will be

                <strong>Important Notes</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your VATSIM membership has lapsed (become inactive), you will need to reactivate your VATSIM membership <em>before</em>

                            href="https://my.vatsim.net/reactivate">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are returning from an absence of 6 months or less, you may have been removed from your home ARTCC. Request a transfer to initiate the rejoin process.</li>
                    <li><strong>It can take up to 24 hours for new, reactivated, or transfers to be processed and sent
