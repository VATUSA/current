    <p>Welcome to the VATUSA Division.</p>

    <p>If you desire to be an Air Traffic Controller within the VATUSA division, please continue reading this email.
        If you desire only to fly, you do not need to read this email and can discard it.</p>

    <p>All initial training is done through the VATUSA Academy which can be found at
        <a href="https://academy.vatusa.net/"></a>https://academy.vatusa.net/</p>

    <p>Still having issues? Your best reference before asking a question will be the FAQ. You can find that at
        <a href="https://www.vatusa.net/help/kb">https://www.vatusa.net/help/kb</a></p>

    <p>Additionally, the VATUSA Discord is a great way to meet other controllers and ask or find answers to some of
        your questions. Learn how to join at <a href="https://discord.gg/a7Qcse7">https://discord.gg/a7Qcse7</a></p>

    <p>If you have any questions, your point of contact until you finish initial training and transfer to your first
