    <p>Welcome to the VATUSA Division.</p>

    <p>If you desire to be an Air Traffic Controller within the VATUSA division, please continue reading this email. If
        you
        desire only to fly, you do not need to read this email and can discard it.</p>

    <p>Firstly, thank you for taking the time to join the division and we look forward to working the scopes with you.
        Firstly, to continue the signup process you need to complete Blocks 1 and 2 (Basic/S1) of the Computer Based
        Training (CBT) courses located under "My VATUSA" and "Computer Based Training" (CBT).
        Then you will need to complete the Basic ATC Exam. <strong>The two CBT blocks must be completed before you can
            take
            the exam.</strong> When you are ready to take this exam, please click "My VATUSA" then "Assign Basic ATC
        Exam".
        Take your time with this exam, and remember it is open book. If you do not pass, you will need to wait 3 days to
        retake so take your time.
        <em><strong>Returning controllers</strong> who completed the exam more than 6 months ago must retake the
            exam.</em></p>

    <p>Until you have completed the Basic ATC Exam, you have been assigned to the Academy facility. After completion of
        the
        examination, you will be permitted to select your initial facility. Please choose carefully, as transfers out of
        the
        facility will need to be in accordance with division transfer policy. This policy can be found at
        www.vatusa.net, Division
        Info, Policies and then reading "Transferring and Visiting Controllers Policy".</p>

    <p>Finally, questions about training should be done through the VATUSA ticketing system, not e-mail.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, your current point of contact until you transfer to your first facility is VATUSA3.
        They
        can be reached at vatusa3@vatusa.net.</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
