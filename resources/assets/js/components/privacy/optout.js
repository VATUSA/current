<h1>Opt Out</h1>
<p>Given the nature of our services, it is not possible to opt out of data collection and use our services.  But if you
desire to opt out and no longer desire to use our services, we will purge all information we have collected upon written request.</p>
<p>The first step is to deactivate and request VATSIM to purge your data.  Please head to <a href="https://membership.vatsim.net/">https://membership.vatsim.net/</a> to do so.</p>
<p>VATSIM, after processing your opt out, will forward the request to VATUSA for processing.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> VATUSA cannot guarantee that information collected by parties outside of VATUSA will be purged in the process.</p>
